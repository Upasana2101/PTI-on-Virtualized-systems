# OS-project
Impact of PTI (Page-table Isolation) on virtualized systems has been studied during this project. PTI provides kernel and user space isolation. It provides kernel security but at the cost of increased overheads. Different PTI settings for Host OS and Guest OS have been used for the analysis. Several overheads like Network overheads, I/O overheads and performance overheads on memory accesses under different settings of PTI have been studied thoroughly in this project.
